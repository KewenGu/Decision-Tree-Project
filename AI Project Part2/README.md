### CS4341 Project3 Part2
### Author: Kewen Gu & Zhaochen Ding

##### Introduction:
In this part of project3, we implemented a decision tree algorithm using k-fold cross validation in python. The data set we used to perform decision tree algorithm on is the one we gathered from part1 of this project. And the five features we have used are:
  Feature 1: which player has more pieces in center rows
  Feature 2: which player has a piece at the bottom left corner of the board
  Feature 3: which player has more pieces in the center column
  Feature 4: which player has more pieces in the bottom row
  Feature 5: which player has more connections of 2 pieces

##### How to run this program:
Note that the python version we used for this program is python 2.7
First, change your directory to where the python file locates, then enter "python Main.py <# of folds>" in the command line (for Windows) or Terminal (for Mac or Linux), just replace <# of folds> with a positive integer less than 1000.
